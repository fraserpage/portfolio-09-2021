        <p>I'm a web developer with great attention to detail and a strong creative impulse. I've been building and playing with code on the internet for something like 15 years now.</p>
        <p>I come from a background in IT support and management. That's given me great empathy for end users and deeply honed troubleshooting skills.</p>

          <p>I'm currenly a WordPress Developer at <a href="http://briteweb.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Briteweb</a>, a social impact agency and strategic partner, specializing in branding, digital and marketing solutions for nonprofits, foundations and purpose-driven companies.</p>
          <p>Until recently, I worked for Iler Campbell LLP, a law firm servicing co-ops, not-for-profits, charities and other people working to make the world a little bit better. My title was IT and Marketing Manager and if that sounds like I wore multiple hats, it's true! </p>
          <p>I pride myself on my adaptability and my ability to do pretty much anything that's needed. At Iler Campbell that meant doing everything from running network traffic packet level analyses to making custom illustrations for firm presentations. I'm proud of my work on streamlining business processes. Working with Iler Campbell's accounting department, for instance, I took their billing process from a weeks long endeavour involving an enormous amount of paper pushing to just a few days and no paper at all. And I also found the time to fit in some web development work. (Check out the year in review sites below.)</p>
          <p>I have done a lot of my web development work with the talented, detail driven and social-good focused designers at <a href="https://rallyrally.design" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">RallyRally</a> (their site is a custom Wordpress website built by me) but I also take on some projects of my own, doing design, dev and even copy writing as needed.</p>
          <p>I'm always working to improve my skills and try new things. One focus that I've brought to a lot of recent client work has been accessibility. </p>
          <p>In 2021 I had the opportunity of some time to myself and enrolled in General Assembly's 3 month, 480+ hour Software Engineering Immersive program in order to push my skills to another level. I am proud to have completed the course with a perfect 4.0 GPA.</p>
          <p>Above all, I love making stuff and learning things along the way.</p>
