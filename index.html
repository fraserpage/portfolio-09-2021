        <p>I'm a web developer with great attention to detail and a strong creative impulse. I've been building and playing with code on the internet for something like 15 years now.</p>
        <p>I come from a background in IT support and management. That's given me great empathy for end users and deeply honed troubleshooting skills.</p>

          <p>I work for Iler Campbell LLP, a law firm servicing co-ops, not-for-profits, charities and other people working to make the world a little bit better. My title is IT and Marketing Manager and if that sounds like I wear multiple hats, I do! I pride myself on my adaptability and my ability to do pretty much anything that's needed. That might mean runing network traffic packet level analyses and it might mean making custom illustrations for firm presentations. I'm proud of my work on streamlining business processes. Working with our accounting department, for instance, I've taken our billing process from a weeks long endevor involving an enormous amount of paper pushing to just a few days and no paper at all. And I also find the time to fit in some web development work. (Check out the year in review site below.)</p>
          <p>I do a lot of my web development work with the talented, detail driven and social-good focused designers at <a href="https://rallyrally.design" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">RallyRally</a> (their site is a custom Wordpress website built by me) but I also take on some projects of my own, doing design, dev and even copy writing as needed.</p>
          <p>I'm always working to improve my skills and try new things. One focus that I've brought to a lot of recent client work has been accessibility. </p>
          <p>In 2021 I had the opportunity of some time to myself and enroled in General Assembly's 3 month, 480+ hour Software Engineering Immersive program in order to push my skills another level. I am proud to have completed the course with a perfect 4.0 GPA.</p>
          <p>Above all, I love making stuff and learning things along the way.</p>
