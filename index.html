      <div class="columns">
        <p>I'm a web developer with great attention to detail and a strong creative impulse. I've been building and playing with code on the internet for something like 15 years now.</p>

          <p>Most recently I've worked as a WordPress Developer at <a href="http://briteweb.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Briteweb</a>, a social impact agency and strategic partner, specializing in branding, digital and marketing solutions for nonprofits, foundations and purpose-driven companies.</p>
          <p>Briteweb's clients do amazing things and I was happy to implement many amazing designs on their behalf.</p>
          <p>I led internal efforts to improve our code quality, our documentation, automate processes and ensure site were built to accessible standards.</p>
          <p>I'm always working to improve my skills and try new things.</p>
          <button id="readmore2">Read even more</button>
        </div>
        <div id="more2">
          <p>Before Briteweb, I worked with the talented, detail driven and social-good focused designers at <a href="https://rallyrally.design" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">RallyRally</a> (their site is a custom WordPress website built by me) and as a freelancer before that, sometimes doing design, dev and even copy writing as needed.</p>
          <p>In 2021 I had the opportunity of some time to myself and enrolled in General Assembly's 3 month, 480+ hour Software Engineering Immersive program in order to push my skills to another level. I am proud to have completed the course with a perfect 4.0 GPA.</p>
          <p>In my earlier career, I worked for Iler Campbell LLP, a law firm servicing co-ops, not-for-profits, charities and other people working to make the world a little bit better. My title was IT and Marketing Manager and if that sounds like I wore multiple hats, it's true! I credit this background for giving me great empathy for end users and deeply honed troubleshooting skills.</p>
          <p>I pride myself on my adaptability and my ability to do pretty much anything that's needed. At Iler Campbell that meant doing everything from running network traffic packet level analyses to making custom illustrations for firm presentations. I'm proud of my work on streamlining business processes. Working with Iler Campbell's accounting department, for instance, I took their billing process from a weeks long endeavour involving an enormous amount of paper pushing to just a few days and no paper at all. And I also found the time to fit in some web development work. (Check out the year in review sites below.)</p>
          
          <p>Above all, I love making stuff and learning things along the way.</p>
